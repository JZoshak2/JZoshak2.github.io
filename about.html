			<h1>I Could Never Pick Just One Thing<h1>

			<p>
				Some stuff to know about me: I’m an avid runner,
				my greyhound’s name is Rocketflamingo, and I’m
				the only biologist/product manager I know. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I live in Washington, DC with my partner and 
				dog - and work at FiscalNote where
				I work with talented designers and engineers
				to ship products that drive business growth. 
				I love a good prototype test, and nothing makes
				me happier than seeing usage stats on my new
				feature spike. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m chronically curious, always at the intersection
				of multiple disciplines, and I’ve been known 
				to throw down in online video games from
				time to time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Want to see what I’m up to? My blog is detailing
				my adventure in coding.
